import CodeBlock from "./CodeBlock";

We can define classes.
For example, the following is a class definition for a simple `Point` class.
It has two parameters `x` and `y` of type `Int`.

<CodeBlock source={`class Point(x: Int, y: Int)`} />

To make parameters accessible by property access `.`.
We have to declare them with `val`.

<CodeBlock source={`class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int)
let origin = Point(0, 0)
origin.x + origin.y // 0`} />

We can also define classes with type parameters.

<CodeBlock source={`class Pair[A, B](val first: A, val second: B)`} />

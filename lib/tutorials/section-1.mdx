### A Gentle Guide to MLscript

What would TypeScript look like if it had been designed with type inference and soundness in mind?

We provide one possible answer in MLscript, an object-oriented and functional programming language with records, generic classes, mix-in traits, first-class unions and intersections, instance matching, and ML-style principal type inference. These features can be used to implement expressive class hierarchies as well as extensible sums and products.

MLscript supports union, intersection, and complement (or negation) connectives, making sure they form a Boolean algebra, and add enough structure to derive a sound and complete type inference algorithm.

Classes can be extended with `extends` keyword.
Here is the definition of `Option` type in MLscript,
which is very common in provided examples.

<CodeBlock source={`abstract class Option[out T]: (Some[T] | None)
class Some[out T](value: T) extends Option[T]
module None extends Option[nothing]`} />

- Class `Option` is abstract and has two sub-classes, `Some` and `None`.
- The `: (Some[T] | None)` clause indicates that type `Option[T]`
  only has two possible subtypes: `Some[T]` and `None`.
- The type parameter `T` is marked as `out` to indicate that it is covariant.
- `module` keyword is used to define a singleton object.
  Here, `None` can be either used as a value or a type.

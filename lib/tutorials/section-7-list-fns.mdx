import CodeBlock from "./CodeBlock";

We can define many functions that operate on lists.
For example, we can define a function that sum all elements in a list.

<CodeBlock source={`fun sum(xs) = if xs is
  Nil then 0
  Cons(x, xs') then x + sum(xs')`} />

You will find out that the `sum` function makes use of
the Ultimate Conditional Syntax, which is the main contribution
of our paper.

Now, you can try out the examples provided in this web demo.
We hope you can tweak the examples and learn more about MLscript.
Have fun!
